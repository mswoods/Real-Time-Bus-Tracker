# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

## Description
This project displays a map of the MIT campus and with the click of a button tracks the bus location between MIT and Harvard. I've made mostly
modifications to the styling of the page which include a custom map, navigation features and MIT color stylings.

## Deployment
The solution is easy to deploy. First, download the files to your local machine and make sure they are in put into the same directory. Using a browser, simply open up the index.html file. To execute the tracking feature, simply click the radio button in the top right had corner of the page. 

## Roadmap/Improvements: 
- Add custom pop-up images/icons at each bus stop
- Add bus stop name pop-ups at each stop
- Add a line layer to the map
